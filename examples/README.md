examples for image to ansi blocks

---------------------------------
tux the satisfied penguin

![screenshot](tux-demo.png)

just sitting there.
complacent with what the project he stands for has achieved.
while maybe hopefully still dignified and humble enough
to recognize the achievement of another project represented by a gnu.

in the lower right corner is an image viewer
showing the original image of tux.
note that the image is zoomed in a couple hundred percents.
the checkered background represents transparent pixels.

cat

![cat demo](cat-demo.png)

just a cat.

this time the image is drawn on a terminal with black background.
since the cat itself is black its pixels "disappear" against the background.
only the eyes remain since they are white.

the cats eyes so bright piercing through the dark.
looking straight at your soul.

i am sure the cat is understanding of all your regrets.
may you be forgiving of your own perceived faults.

with the `--background` argument you can have all transparent pixels
to be drawn in the requested background color instead.
