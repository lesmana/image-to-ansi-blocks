examples for image to ansi blocks

---------------------------------
tux the satisfied penguin

![screenshot of tux icon in terminal](tux-demo.png)

just sitting there.
complacent with what the project he stands for has achieved.
while maybe hopefully still dignified and humble enough
to recognize the achievement of another project represented by a gnu.

in the lower right corner is an image viewer
showing the original image of tux.
note that the image is zoomed in a couple hundred percents.
the checkered background represents transparent pixels.

cat

![screenshot of cat icon in terminal](cat-demo.png)

just a cat.

this time the image is drawn on a terminal with black background.
since the cat itself is black its pixels "disappear" against the background.
only the eyes remain since they are white.

the cats eyes so bright piercing through the dark.
looking straight at your soul.

i am sure the cat is understanding of all your regrets.
may you be forgiving of your own perceived faults.

with the `--background` argument you can have all transparent pixels
to be drawn in the requested background color instead.

perhaps the most iconic 8 bit pixel ... icon.

catmario

also known as syobon action

one of the best mario clones out there.
besides just being a good jump and run
it is also deeply philosophical and teaches core inner values.

it tought me acceptance and perseverance.
i learned that i always may try again no matter how often i failed.
also how to count backwards to negative numbers.

dog

![screenshot of dog icon in terminal](dog-demo.png)

this dog is from the game undertale.
i have not played that game so i can not say anything about it.
i just liked the dog smile.

this dog is again drawn in a terminal with black background.
at first it seems just like a white dog.
but with some other background color it is visible
that the dog has a black pixel line around it.

the black pixel line disappears at the border of the image.
with `--border` you can draw a one pixel line around the image.
this will prevent a pixel line at the border to disappear
against the terminal background color.
